#+TITLE: Grip TODO file

* Grip

** Autotool

- [ ] gglobalsitedir=$(GUILE_GLOBAL_SITE) is not properly set
      -> see am/guile.mk and make printenv to check
- [ ] we need gccache, not just gsiteccache [which works ^^ ?]
- [ ] ggcflags=@GUILE_GNOME_CFLAGS@ does not work either
      -> see env.in, guile-gnome-2.m4 and configure.ac

** Release

- [ ] removing/commenting all dimfi calls before to release

** utils.scm

- [ ] bag instead of storage?
- [ ] then make-bag so 1 app can have more then 1 bag:

	(define bag1 (make-bag))
	(bag1 'get key)
	(bag1 'set key val)

** csv

- [ ] csv is still missing, need to work on that

* Grip-SQLite
* Grip-Gnome
* Grip-Clutter [42%]

- [X] add layout to <clus-apple>
- [X] box-layout -> layout from <clus-apple>
- [ ] grid-layout -> layout from <clus-apple>
- [ ] have to think about how to handle the 'border' if any 
- [X] bin must be like box, inherit from <clus-apple>
