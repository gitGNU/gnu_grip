;;; Commentary:

;; This code needs review and/or be rewritten: it is imported almost 'as
;; is' from 'common', grip's ancestor, started while using guile-1.6, a
;; past where I could not trust the module system, goops, and myself [:)
;; as a schemer].  But I want grip-0.1.0 and kise-0.9.5 ready asap to
;; talk to svannah, gitorious has been murdered.

;;; Code:


(define-module (grip utils)
  #:export (storage
	    storage-get
	    storage-set
	    displayln
	    dimfi))


(define storage #f)
(define storage-get #f)
(define storage-set #f)

(eval-when (expand load eval)
  (set! storage (list))
  (set! storage-get
	(lambda (key)
	  ;; (format #t "~S~%" storage)
	  (case key
	    ((all) storage)
	    (else
	     (assq-ref storage key)))))
  (set! storage-set
	(lambda (key value)
	  ;; (format #t "~S~%" storage)
	  (set! storage
		(assq-set! storage key value)))))


(define* (displayln msg #:optional (port #f))
  (if port
      (begin
	(display msg port)
	(newline port))
      (begin
	(display msg)
	(newline))))

(define (dimfi . items)
  ;; if the first item is a port, we use it.
  (if (port? (car items))
      (let ((p (car items)))
	(display ";; " p)
	(for-each (lambda (item)
		    (display item p) (display " " p))
	    (cdr items))
	(display "\n" p))
      (begin
	(display ";; ")
	(for-each (lambda (item)
		    (display item) (display " " ))
	    items)
	(display "\n")))
  (car (last-pair items)))
