* Grip

Grip, a Grip of Really Important Procedures, is a Guile
http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/ Scheme toolbox
currently composed of Grip itself, Grip-SQLite, Grip-Gnome and
Grip-Clutter.

Grip, Grip-SQLite and Grip-Gnome are mostly used by GNU Foliot,
http://www.gnu.org/software/foliot/ - a small and easy to use time
keeping application - entirely written in Guile.

	Note: Grip, Grip-SQLite and Grip-Gnome need to be and will be
      rewritten, I started already, you'll spot that by yourself in the
      code if you visit it: indeed, they come from old times, when I
      could not trust the Guile's module system, Goops ... and myself
      [as a schemer :)].

Grip-Clutter is recent and reasonably well designed and coded, despite
some Goops problems, which we're working on with Guile's maintainers,
but it still needs more and some app(s) to proove this. So no fixed API
yet either. It has some good Clutter examples, more to come soon.

So, all this said, you are welcome to try and use Grip, keeping the
above in mind, come and help to get it better designed, coded and
debugged, thanks!
